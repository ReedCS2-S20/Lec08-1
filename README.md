# Lecture 08-1

This is a folder containing the lecture materials for Monday, March 30th's on-line lecture. It includes  
• PDF of my lecture slides (which might change by noon) `slides.pdf`   
• the material covered by lecture as notes (which will change by noon) `NOTES.md`     
• some sample MIPS assembly source code in `samples`  
I'll email you an invitation to the Zoom lecture which will be held at 3-4pm.

There are two (optional) practice exercises at the end of the lecture slides. You can work on these for the next lecture.
